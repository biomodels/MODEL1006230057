# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A mathematical model for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and T cell interaction.**   
Moore H, Li NK. _J Theor Biol_ 2004 Apr 21;227(4):513-23

**Abstract:**   
In this paper, we propose and analyse a mathematical model for chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML), a cancer of the blood. We model the interaction
between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body,
using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change
of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the
scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values.
To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling
(LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major
goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical
role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis
examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death
rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate
that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those
that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates),
while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.
